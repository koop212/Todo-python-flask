# Todo-python-flask
 
 Created my first application with Python3 and Flask.  The app allows you enter tasks with today's date. Then you are able to delete it or update the tasks.
 
 ## PREREQUISITES
 Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:
 
 * An IDE [VSCode is recommended](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 * [Python](https://www.python.org/)
 * [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/)
 
 ## DEVELOPMENT SETUP

* Navigate to `localhost:5000`
